Udacity practice

The first change Audacity wants to try is on their homepage. They hope that this new, more engaging design will increase the number of users who explore their courses and move on to the second stage of the funnel.

The metric we will use is the click-through rate for the Explore Courses button on the home page. Click-through rate (CTR) is often defined as the number of clicks divided by the number of views. Since Audacity uses cookies, we can identify unique users and make sure we don't count the same one multiple times.
